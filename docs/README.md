## Background

A Smart Machine Base (SMB) was developed by Demcon, consisting of a generic machine platform with standardized controls. Part of the project was the development of an IoT agent which is able to listen to the machine on its south port and present some OEE and sensor data to the FIWARE Context Broker. This information can then in turn be used for MES, remote diagnosis etc.
