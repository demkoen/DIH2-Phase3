## IoT Agent

### Check registered devices

| :information_source: Tip                                                               |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|use [reqbin.com/curl](https://reqbin.com/curl) for in browser curl commands and feedback|

To check the devices that are registerd in the IoT agent you need to know the registered service. In our example project, the fiware-service is ```_units```

![check registered devices](../images/reqbin_com_curl.png)

example code:

```curl
curl -X GET \
'http://10.11.118.60:4041/iot/devices' \
-H 'fiware-service: _units' \
-H 'fiware-servicepath: /'
```

Please refer to the [Fiware IoT Agent documentation](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.IoT-Agent) for more advanced commands
