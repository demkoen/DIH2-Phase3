## Requirements

- Docker (Version 19.03.1+)
- Docker-compose (Version 1.24.1+)

Install docker and docker-compose by following the instructions available on the official web site:

- [Docker: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)
- [Docker-Compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Once docker has been correctly installed you can continue with the other steps

## Step 1

First of all, you have to setup and configure the server. This is explained in the [installationguid](installationguide.md).

## Step 2

After installing and configuring the server and all docker containers are up and running, you can start to send messages to the server via MQTT. How the messages should be presented is explained in the [api description](api.md).

## Step 3

To debug and configure your setup, a bunch of tools and tips are explained in the [user manual](usermanual.md).
